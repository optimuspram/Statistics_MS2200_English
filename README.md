# Statistics_MS2200_English
This is a collection of R Markdown files that I use for teaching MS 2200 (Statistics) at Institut Teknologi Bandung. There are four tutorials: Hypothesis testing, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and single factor ANOVA. Some notes:
- You can read the tutorial in either PDF or HTML format.
- You can open the R Markdown files using Rstudio. 
- Github does not automatically display R Markdown files. Instead, you can view the PDF files in Github or the HTML files using htmlpreview.github.io
